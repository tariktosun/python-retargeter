% Description:
%   Imitation function for the chainMotion class.  Returns a new
%   chainMotion with the source motion retargeted to the target chain.
% Usage:
%   retMotion = motionImitation(sourceMotion, targetChain,{makeImitation params});
%   {makeImitation_params} all get passed directly to chain3d.makeImitation.

    dof = targetChain.numlinks();
    N = sourceMotion.numFrames();
