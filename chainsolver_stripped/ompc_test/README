=One MATLAB(R) Per Child=

_An open-source MATLAB(R) to Python compiler_

Author: `Peter Jurica <juricap@gmail.com>`

==Introduction==

OMPC (http://ompc.juricap.com) aims to allow effortless reuse of MATLAB code 
from Python. OMPC is a code adaptation layer that translates MATLAB's m-files
into Python compatible syntax. The generated Python compatible code 
depends on OMPClib which provides MATLAB compatible array interface for Python.
The OMPClib interface is another numerical Python library but the only one with 
indexing based at 1 instead at 0, strict FORTRAN binary interface and 
copy on assignment.

  
==Download and Installation==

Download the OMPC source code through:

  or directly
  
  hg clone http://bitbucket.org/juricap/ompc/

==Using==

To use OMPC simply import it in your Python session.

  import ompc

Importing OMPC installs an import hook that will enable importing of 
MATLAB compatible files into to current Python session. This means 
that for example a file 'add.m' can be imported using the following statement:

  import add

The import hooks, upon finding the m-file named 'add.m', call the OMPC compiler
that adapts the code for use with the OMPClib and calls the Python compiler 
to create the resulting 'add.pyc' file. This exactly replicates the result 
produced by importing a python module.
